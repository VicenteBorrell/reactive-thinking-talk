# Motivation

---

## Motivation

- Inmutability
- Side states safe (clear source of truth)
- Binding
- Encapsulated Observable actions
- Composable
- Ease operatiosn
- Threading (observer & execute)

---

# Reactive Thinking

---

## Creating Observables

- External actions
- Existing Patterns
- Backend actions

---

## Combining and plying with Observables

---

## Observing

- Binding
- Subscribing

---

#Caveats

---

## Debugging

---

## Retain cycles

---

## Threading?

---
